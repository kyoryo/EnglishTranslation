# Tree Of Savior INA - English Translation Porting (Unofficial)

Because of how shitty Indonesian translation made by Gemscool. I've decided to port the current English Translation Project to Tree Of Savior INA.

## How to Install
1. Download the archive from [release](https://github.com/kyoryo/EnglishTranslation/releases)
2. Copy (the archives).rar to "~\Tree Of Savior INA\release\languageData"
3. Right click >> extract here
4. Navigate to folder "~\Tree Of Savior INA\release"
5. Login into game and English option should be available in Option menu.


## Legal Notes
Reminder, this patch doesn't count as addon. First thing first, this patch forked from official steam English translation project. Because, second, this patch didn't change the other game values except language, so you can call it save.
IMC has said that mods and addons are ok and doesnâ€™t go against their Terms Of Service. And why IMC? Because why not?
Also this is absolutely not HARAM, at least.
